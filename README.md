### Pebble Meditation App

This is an app for the [Pebble Smartwatch][1]. 

The idea for this app originated from user *eyeis* on the [Pebble forums][2].

The app allows you to create multiple, independent countdown timers with an optional vibration at the end. You can also add stopwatches, which are just like timers except they count up.

#### Install

You can install this watchface by clicking [this link][3] on the Android or iOS device that you have paired to your Pebble watch.
